Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to retain customers and improve service strategies. This notebook uses logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze and predict customer churn based on various features.

Features
Data Preprocessing:
Prepares the dataset by handling missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training:
Trains a logistic regression model with regularization to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation Metrics:
Includes confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics for model performance evaluation.

Visualization:
Plots a confusion matrix to provide visual insights into the classification results.

Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
To install these, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAlForman/Logistic-Regression-Churn.git
cd Logistic-Regression-Churn
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Class-Logistic-Reg-churn.ipynb
Run the notebook cell by cell to reproduce the results.

Results
The notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance, including key metrics such as:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision & Recall: Metrics to evaluate model reliability for churn detection.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
