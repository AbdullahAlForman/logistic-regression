## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to retain customers and improve service strategies. This notebook uses logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze and predict customer churn based on various features.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  Prepares the dataset by handling missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical variables.  

- **Model Training**:  
  Trains a logistic regression model with regularization to prevent overfitting.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  Includes confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics for model performance evaluation.

- **Visualization**:  
  Plots a confusion matrix to provide visual insights into the classification results.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `scikit-learn`  

To install these, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahAlForman/Logistic-Regression-Churn.git
   cd Logistic-Regression-Churn
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Class-Logistic-Reg-churn.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the notebook cell by cell to reproduce the results.

## Results

The notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance, including key metrics such as:  
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.  
- **Precision & Recall**: Metrics to evaluate model reliability for churn detection.  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
